# LMLMTFY - Let Me Language Model That For You

A sarcastic tool to show people how to use language models to answer their questions, inspired by [letmegooglethat.com](https://letmegooglethat.com) and [letmegpt.com](https://letmegpt.com).

## Purpose

LMLMTFY (Let Me Language Model That For You) is a web application designed to create shareable links that demonstrate how to use a language model to answer questions. It's a playful way to respond to questions that could easily be answered by a language model, similar to how "Let Me Google That For You" works for search engines.

When someone shares an LMLMTFY link, the recipient sees an animation of someone typing their question into a language model interface and receiving an answer - showing them how they could have done it themselves.

## Features

- Clean, modern interface mimicking a generic language model
- Three.js powered animations showing the typing process
- Shareable links that demonstrate the query process
- Mobile-responsive design

## Implementation Methodology

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **3D Animation**: Three.js
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

### Three.js Implementation Plan

We'll use Three.js to create a visually appealing, modern language model interface with subtle animations:

1. **Scene Setup**: Create a 3D scene with a camera positioned to view the language model interface
2. **Interface Design**: Design a clean, minimalist language model interface with:
   - Text input area
   - "Ask Language Model" button
   - Response area
3. **Animation Sequence**:
   - Cursor movement to the text input area
   - Typing animation for the query text
   - Click animation on the "Ask Language Model" button
   - Loading animation
   - Display of a generic language model response
4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Allow users to create their own LMLMTFY links
   - Copy button for easy sharing
   - Preview functionality

### Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Basic interface and functionality
   - Create the HTML/CSS structure
   - Implement basic Three.js scene
   - Set up the query input and URL generation

2. **Phase 2**: Animation and interaction
   - Develop the typing and clicking animations
   - Implement the response generation
   - Add share functionality

3. **Phase 3**: Polish and optimization
   - Optimize for mobile devices
   - Add visual polish and transitions
   - Implement performance optimizations

## Usage

1. Enter a question in the input field
2. Click "Ask Language Model"
3. Share the generated link with someone who could have used a language model themselves
