# LMLMTFY - Let Me Language Model That For You

An educational tool to demonstrate how language models can provide accurate, cited answers to questions, inspired by the concept of [letmegooglethat.com](https://letmegooglethat.com) but with an ethical alternative to Google's search.

## Purpose

LMLMTFY (Let Me Language Model That For You) is a web application designed to create shareable links that demonstrate the power and ease of using language models to answer questions with proper citations. Unlike Google, which often prioritizes ad revenue and tracks user data, language models can provide direct, comprehensive answers without the privacy concerns.

When someone shares an LMLMTFY link, the recipient sees an informative demonstration of how to use a language model to get precise answers with citations - empowering them with a better alternative to traditional search engines.

## Features

- Clean, modern interface showcasing a generic language model
- Three.js powered animations demonstrating the question-answering process
- Shareable links that educate users on getting accurate, cited information
- Mobile-responsive design
- Emphasis on privacy and ethical information retrieval
- Dual modes:
  - **With Citations**: Provides accurate, properly cited information
  - **Without Citations**: Humorous mode that intentionally gives famous AI hallucinations and mistakes

## Implementation Methodology

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **3D Animation**: Three.js
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

### Three.js Implementation Plan

We'll use Three.js to create a visually appealing, modern language model interface with subtle animations:

1. **Scene Setup**: Create a 3D scene with a camera positioned to view the language model interface
2. **Interface Design**: Design a clean, minimalist language model interface with:
   - Text input area
   - "Ask Language Model" button
   - Response area
   - Mode toggle switch between "With Citations" and "Without Citations"
3. **Animation Sequence**:
   - Cursor movement to the text input area
   - Typing animation for the query text
   - Click animation on the "Ask Language Model" button
   - Loading animation
   - Display of response (accurate with citations or humorous hallucination based on mode)
4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Allow users to create their own LMLMTFY links
   - Copy button for easy sharing
   - Preview functionality
   - Mode selection for demonstration
